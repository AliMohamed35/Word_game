Welcome to the "Guess the Word" game repository! 
This interactive web-based game challenges players to guess a hidden word letter by letter. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game offers a seamless and engaging experience right from your browser.
The HTML provides the structure and layout, while CSS enhances the visual appeal with stylish designs and animations. JavaScript brings the game to life by handling user inputs, tracking game progress, and updating the interface dynamically. 
Whether you're a developer interested in learning more about these technologies or just someone looking for a fun and addictive game, 
this project is a great example of how to combine these tools into a cohesive and enjoyable experience. Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, 
or use it as a starting point for your own creative projects!
